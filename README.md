# wc Tool

wc Tool is a tool similar to that of Unix's CLI tool wc. It takes input and outputs the word, byte, character, line count. Inspired from [Coding Challenges](https://codingchallenges.fyi/) by [John Crickett](https://github.com/JohnCrickett).

## Tech Stack

- JS/TS
- Node.js

## Milestones

- [ ] Write first version of wc command that takes the command line option -c and outputs the number of bytes in a file
- [ ] Support for command line option -l that outputs the number of lines in a file.
- [ ] Support for command line option -w that outputs the number of words in a file.
- [ ] Support for command line option -m that outputs the number of characters in a file. If the current locale does not support multibyte characters this will match the -c option.
- [ ] Support for default option - i.e. no options are provided, which is the equivalent to the -c, -l and -w options.
- [ ] Support for being able to read from standard input if no filename is specified.
